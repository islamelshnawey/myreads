# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 


## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`


## What You're Getting

```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.
